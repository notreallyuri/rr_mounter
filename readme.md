# RR Mounter

**RR Mounter** is a foundational Rust crate that provides all the core types and structs used to build custom sources/extensions for the [RR Manga Reader] project (name can be updated later). It acts as the shared schema for how source data like manga entries, chapters, and metadata are represented across multiple independent sources.
